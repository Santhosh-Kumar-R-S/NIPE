SAMPLE LEGAL DOCUMENT - CONTRACT DISPUTE

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

JOHN DOE, Plaintiff,
v.
ABC CORPORATION, Defendant.

Case No. 23-CV-1234

MEMORANDUM OPINION

This matter comes before the Court on Defendant ABC Corporation's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

BACKGROUND

Plaintiff John Doe entered into an employment contract with Defendant ABC Corporation on January 1, 2020. The contract contained a non-compete clause preventing Plaintiff from working for competing companies within a 50-mile radius for a period of two years following termination of employment.

On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff's employment was terminated. On April 1, 2023, Plaintiff accepted employment with XYZ Industries, a direct competitor of ABC Corporation, located 25 miles from ABC Corporation's headquarters.

ABC Corporation filed suit alleging breach of contract and seeking injunctive relief to enforce the non-compete agreement. Plaintiff argues the non-compete clause is overly broad and unenforceable under state law.

LEGAL STANDARD

To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. The Court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.

DISCUSSION

Under New York law, non-compete agreements are enforceable only to the extent they are reasonable in time and geographic scope, necessary to protect the employer's legitimate interests, and not harmful to the public interest.

The Court finds that the two-year duration is reasonable given the nature of the industry and the Plaintiff's senior position. However, the 50-mile geographic restriction may be overly broad considering the specific market area in which ABC Corporation operates.

Additionally, Plaintiff has raised valid questions regarding whether ABC Corporation has legitimate protectable interests, such as trade secrets or confidential customer relationships, that justify the enforcement of this agreement.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. The case will proceed to discovery on the issues of the reasonableness of the geographic scope and the existence of legitimate protectable interests.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
